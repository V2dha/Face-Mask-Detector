# Face-Mask-Detector
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
whole world is in turmoil and is thinking of innovative solutions
to prevent the spread of the virus. As a precautionary measure,
people around the world are wearing masks to avoid contracting
this virus. While some are following and taking this measure,
some are not still not following despite official advice from the
government and public health agencies. In this project, a face mask
detection model that can accurately detect whether a person
is wearing a mask or not is implemented. The
model architecture uses MobileNetV2 which is a lightweight
convolutional neural network therefore requires less
computational power and can be easily embedded in computer
vision systems and mobile. As a result, it can create a low-cost
mask detector system which can help to identify whether a
person is wearing a mask or not and act as a surveillance system
as it works for both real time images and videos. The face
detector model achieved high accuracy of 99.98% on training
data, 99.56% on validation data and 99.75% on testing data.
